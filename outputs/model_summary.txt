Model Summary – Logistic Regression Baseline
--------------------------------------------
Accuracy:  0.729  (72.9%)
Precision: 0.578
Recall:    0.439
F1-Score:  0.499

Null Hypothesis: Metadata features do not predict popularity.
Alternative: Metadata features provide predictive value.

Result: With accuracy above the 0.5 random baseline and non-zero feature weights,
we reject the Null in favor of the Alternate. Metadata features (platform, type, release_year, genres)
carry measurable predictive signal for title popularity.
