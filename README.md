## Overview

This project examines how major streaming platforms, Netflix, Disney+, and Amazon Prime, act as cultural intermediaries by curating and promoting international media.  
The goal is to compare how each platform represents content, and test whether the metadata can predict popularity whiel also identifying cross-platform cultural groupings.

This analysis will combine exploratory data analysis (EDA), classification, and clustering methods to study representation patterns and cultural diversity across the three streaming services.

## Research Questions

1. How do Netflix, Disney+, and Amazon Prime differ in representing international titles by country, genre, and release year?  
2. Can we predict whether a title will be “popular” based on its metadata (platform, genre, country, year, and type)?  
3. What clusters or groupings emerge when titles are grouped by metadata features?  
4. Which platform functions most effectively as a cultural ambassador based on these results?
